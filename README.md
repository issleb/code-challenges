# code-challenges
Exercises I've done on my own or for job interviews in the past.

- **Simple** stuff, mostly data structures and string manipulation.
- **Sorter** that sorts some strings. Not much more complicated than the simple stuff, but with tests!
- **MacGuffin** dates to 2016 and is done in classic .NET. Enjoy!
